## Purpose

To investigate the inefficiency in high-pT region observed in L3/L1



## Check 1

Efficiency from the fitting



### 2016 data

List of triggers

* IsoMu24 over L1

* IsoTkMu24 over L1
* IsoMu24 or IsoTkMu24 over L1

* Mu50 over L1

* TkMu50 over L1



Amount of the data: run ≥  283052 (5 /fb)

* To be consistent with the result from the cut & count results



Binning

* vs pT: 30, 40, 50, 60, 120, 200, 500 GeV
* vs. eta, phi, vtx as usual



### 2018 data

List of triggers

* IsoMu24 over L1
* Mu50 over L1



Amount of the data: run ≥  324315 (5 /fb)

- To be consistent with the result from the cut & count results



Binning

* Same with 2016 case



## Check 2

MC efficiency



### 2016 data

MC reweighting: should be done on 5 /fb data (run ≥ 283052)

The other conditions are same with check 1





## Appendix

EMTF bug: fixed in run ≥ 277166
